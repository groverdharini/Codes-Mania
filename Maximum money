Very basic gfg

Given a street of N houses (a row of houses), each house having K amount of money kept inside; now there is a thief who is going to steal this money but he has a constraint/rule that he cannot steal/rob two adjacent houses. Find the maximum money he can rob.
  public:
    int maximizeMoney(int N , int K) {
        if(N%2==0){
        cout<<(N/2)*K;}
        else
        cout<<(N/2+1)*K;
        }
    
};
